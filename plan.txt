the idea:

1.  in user test script we define:

    A.  a big list of test cases
            each test case defines
                its name
                its purpose
                command line args with marked-up paths to in-dir and out-dir

        (it is assumed that if we know the test-case dir and the test data dir
        we can infer what absolute paths to use for in-dir and out-dir)

    B.  which function to call with all the args to run a test
            eg the main(args) function of some script

2.  when we run the test framework we say:

    where the test data dir is (pass on command line/some env var?)

3.  during test collection phase

    we generate a list of (bindings, test_case) pairs
    each one gets resolved to a system test
    use parametric test nonsense

4.  during test execution phase

    what a surprise, we execute tests
