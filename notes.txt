to update the directory structure diagram, use

    tree --charset ansi example

it is possible to convert colourful terminal output to html, using

    script
    ansi2html (https://raw.github.com/pixelb/scripts/master/scripts/ansi2html.sh)

e.g.

    script
    make
    exit
    cat typescript | ~/Downloads/ansi2html.sh --bg=dark > out.html

but, not immediately sure how to easily weave this into the existing markdown readme.

it would make for pretty examples!
